                <h3>The Tragedy of Coriolanus</h3>
                <h4>SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius</h4>
                
                <h5>
                COMINIUS
                Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
                we are come off
                Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
                Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
                We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
                By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
                The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
                Lead their successes as we wish our own,
                That both our powers, with smiling
                fronts encountering,
                May give you thankful sacrifice.
                Enter a Messenger
                
                Thy news?

                Messenger
                The citizens of Corioli have issued,
                And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
                I saw our party to their trenches driven,
                And then I came away.

                COMINIUS
                Though thou speak'st truth,
                Methinks thou speak'st not well.
                How long is't since?

                Messenger
                Above an hour, my lord.

                COMINIUS
                'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
                How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
                And bring thy news so late?

                Messenger
                Spies of the Volsces
                Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
                Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
                Half an hour since brought my report.

                COMINIUS
                Who's yonder,
                That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
                He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
                Before-time seen him thus.

                MARCIUS
                [Within] Come I too late?

                COMINIUS
                The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
                More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
                From every meaner man.
                Enter MARCIUS
                </h5>
